# Pixel-Art-Maker-Project
This project is my submission  for the Udacity Introduction to Programming Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of JavaScript and HTML event listeners by building a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

## How to Use.

1. Set the canvas size using the width and height input selects boxes. When finished, click on submit.
2. Choose a color from the color picker input box.
3. Click on any box in the grid to change that boxes color.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until your design is complete.
